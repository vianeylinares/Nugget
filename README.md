# Nugget

This project goal was to generate a group of files to host three different types of microsites(Simple, Basic, Medium) displayed in ‘click-mx.com’ subdomains.

Each microsite presents an ad/offer related to a specific company.

### Nugget admin system

The Nugget system can manage diverse options:
<ul>
<li>List of microsites/companies online.</li>
<li>Microsites creation, edition, delete and disable.</li>
<li>Modify the content quickly and safely for staff users. No code skills are required.</li>
<li>Keep track of offer ratings and averages by end-users.</li>
<li>Coupon generation and availability display at backend.</li>
<li>Mailchimp connection and data register.</li>
<li>CSV report generation.</li>
<li>Login/Logout.</li>
<li>Admin user generation.</li>
</ul>


### Microsites

At frontend the microsites display an offer/ad. The design of these microsites has predefined spaces, each of which can assign either color or images as backgrounds. Also, the system can establish a specific Google Font for text display.

Simple type: This displays general details about the offer.

Basic type: This displays general details about the offer. By clicking the image offer, the user is taken to a different page to fill out a contact form. Once the contact form is processed, the system will create a coupon. The coupon will be sent by email to the user.

Medium type: This displays general details about the offer and a contact form. Once the form is processed, the system will email the company manager the user data.
